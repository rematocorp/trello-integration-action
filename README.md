This GitHub action integrates GitHub and Trello, automatically updating Trello cards with pull request information to minimize redundant manual work.

The action looks for:

-   Trello card URLs from PR description, comments and commit messages,
-   Trello card short ID from PR branch name,

and:

-   links a PR to a Trello card and vice versa,
-   moves a Trello card when PR is opened, moved back to draft or closed,
-   adds a label to a Trello card based on the branch name (e.g. `feature/foo`),
-   assigns a PR author and fellow contributors to a Trello card,
-   and more...

#### 4. `github-allow-multiple-cards-in-pr-branch-name`

Allows to reference multiple card short IDs in the branch name (e.g. feature/38-39-40-foo-bar).
